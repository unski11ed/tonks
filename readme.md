# TONKS!

A simple recreation of a popular NES game. Made within a long weekend to test out TypeScript when it was in a very early version ~2013.

Recovered from the depths of an old hard drive and restructured to meet some modern standards. After some work it may have potential to be actually fun.

## TODO:

Lot's of things are missing / not working properly. Here are some of them: (PR's are welcome :D)

- Ice tiles are not working (no sliding)
- There is no sound
- Could use a mobile version and a cool mobile touch controller immitation
- Game Pad controller support?
- Power Ups aren't 100% accurate [Info link](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Battle_City/How_to_play)
- Sprites sheet should be updated. Player tanks are upgrading their power, but there is no visual feedback - missing sprites. [Resource?](https://www.spriters-resource.com/nes/batcity/)
- Tanks and Bullets speeds are inaccurate
- AI probably isn't 1:1, but works quite ok
- The architecture of this thing looks a bit wierd, very tightly coupled, but maybe it's okay for such a game? Needs some thinking.
